### Feature ideas
- NO autoclick or bad autoclick progression
- Overdriver: timed multiplier, charged by clicking
- Multiplier: level based persistend multiplier, x number of clicks results in 0.01 mult increase, x increased with each level
- Mini-games: reward currency, upgrades or timed multiplier
- CookieClickers style "cookie-showers"
- Dynamic Ui
- Over-the-top on screen effects and sounds
- Floating numbers?
- Progression: Upgrade unlocks at milestones, maybe also visual changes
- Secondary resource for specific occasions (milestone upgrades?)
- Progress bar, graph or other evolution (callback to visual changes)
- Random events?
- Stats?
- Prestige System: Permanent Upgrades and Cosmetics
- Bug loan system: A certain upgrade, that will leave you with negative bugs fixed => UI glitchy/bugged
- litlle funny hats

### Emotional Manipulation
- Surprises and memorable moments
- Affection and Connection, bonding with pet/game
- Humor: tomfoolery and mischief
- Mystery and Lore (might be a bust)
- Progress Satisfaction: "celebration" for moments and milestones, visual elements(callback to progress bars), sounds ("Ding!")
- Personal acknowledgement: "I'm pround of you son."
- Leveling System: Make the User aware of the progress made
